Spectre Divide Color Bot - Technical POC
üéÆ Project Overview
A proof-of-concept color recognition bot developed for Spectre Divide PC game that takes a unique approach using compute shaders with multiple passes to detect enemy outlines. This project demonstrates advanced technical concepts including DirectX11 integration, HLSL shader programming, multi-threading, and advanced mathematical concepts like octic bezier curves.
